<male sad slow>  
I once stood alone beneath a grey sky, counting the raindrops that matched the heaviness in my chest.  

<female calm medium>  
But then a quiet breeze reminded me that even the clouds move on, and with them, so can sorrow.  

<male happy fast>  
Suddenly the sun broke through—bam!—lighting every puddle like liquid gold, and I laughed louder than the thunder that had just passed.  

<female excited fast whisper>  
Imagine the thrill of secrets carried on a spark of lightning, racing from heart to heart.  

<male heroic medium>  
So hear me now: every storm carves a path for heroes, and every heartbeat drums the march toward brighter skies.  

<female reflective slow>  
And when night finally settles, let its velvet hush remind us that stars are just memories of light, whispering, *“begin again.”*
